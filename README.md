This is created to learn OSEK standard practically. And therefore setting a path towards learning AUTOSAR.

Some of this work is derived from Zephyr OS, hence most of the files here would have the same content and license information (Apache 2.0)

Motivation to create an OS came from Ashokkumar Narayanan.
